\chapter{Conclusion}

This document was first designed for the chair of  Data Science: Statistics and Optimization, was then extended to be used by both data science chairs. Finally, it was again extended to include the chair of Digital Innovation and the Public Sector. It builds on three preliminary works: for one thing it incorporates parts of the style guide of Prof.\ J{\"o}rg Becker's Chair, which can partially be found translated in this document. Additionally, it partially builds on Stephan Dlugosz' one-size-fits-all template for the Information Systems department. Moreover, it uses content extracted from the template provided by Prof.\ Gottfried Vossen's Chair.
